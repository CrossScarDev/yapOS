# Planned

Things I'm planning to add.

## Launcher

- [ ] Only render when scrolling
- [ ] Add option to animate icons
- [ ] Add option to customize scrolling speed
- [ ] Press `B` to see info in fullscreen

## Settings

- [ ] Custom build system to patch official settings app
- [ ] Integrate options with launcher
- [ ] Don't allow on device system updates (It would delete yapOS)

## Installer

- [x] Make FunnyLoader optional
- [x] Allow installing other operating systems (FunnyOS and Index OS)
- [ ] Copy access token generated while downloading PlaydateOS onto device
- [ ] Make it actually install
